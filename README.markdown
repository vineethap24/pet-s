# Status

You should rather have a look at [Simple PetStore](https://github.com/testinfected/simple-petstore), a rewrite of the PetStore with simple tools
and frameworks (Simpleframework, JDBC, Buildr, no IoC container).

I don't plan to make significant changes to this version anymore.

# About

A sample Java web application to demonstrate applying the principles and practices described in Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce book, [Growing Object Oriented Software, Guided by Tests](http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/).

This version is built on top of:
* Spring MVC 3.0
* Spring Core 3.0
* Hibernate 3.5
* Velocity 1.6
* Sitemesh 2
* Bean Validation API 1.0
* Maven 2/3.

# Getting Started

See the [wiki](https://github.com/testinfected/petstore/wiki/_pages) for information on building and starting the application.
